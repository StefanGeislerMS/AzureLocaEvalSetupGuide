# AzureLocaEvalSetupGuide
This repository contains a comprehensive step-by-step setup guide for configuring a two-node Azure Local cluster on a local Hyper-V host for evaluation purposes.

Azure Local extends Azure capabilities to your on-premises datacenter or edge location. Typically, certified hardware is required to run Azure Local, and the setup is usually handled by your hardware provider. However, if you choose to undertake the setup yourself, you will need to familiarize yourself with numerous prerequisites and a series of manual steps that must be executed in the correct order.

For those who wish to evaluate or demonstrate Azure Local, this setup guide provides a simplified process. It will assist you in configuring a two-node Azure Local cluster on an on-premises Hyper-V host using two virtual machines, ensuring a hassle-free experience. While this setup is not fine-tuned and may not offer the same performance as real hardware, it is sufficient for learning or demonstration purposes. Additionally, it helps you avoid common pitfalls.
